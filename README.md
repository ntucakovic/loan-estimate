# Loan Estimator - Playground Series

Mini application used for quick calculations on flat loans.

Available on [loan-estimator.ntmedia.me](https://loan-estimator.ntmedia.me)

First released mini project, part of playground series in which I'll build mini MVPs to serve useful everyday purposes.

TODO:
- Generic version of estimator as well (w/o being tied to flats).
- Multilingual application.
    - ~~Simple translation with predefined strings.~~
    - ~~Based on language browser settings.~~
    - Easily overridable.
- Generate variations from base calculation.
- Save generated entries in local storage so you can reach all of them later on (currently only saving last entries).
