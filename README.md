# Loan Estimator - Playground Series

Mini application used for quick calculations on flat loans.

Available on [loan-estimator.ntmedia.me](https://loan-estimator.ntmedia.me)

First released mini project, part of playground series in which I'll build mini MVPs to serve useful everyday purposes.

I believe that this project is a decent example for [ContextAPI](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html).  
You can also find some [Basic animation usage](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group), check out (yet) another idea to React's architecture, etc.  

Feel free to compare code between `v1.4.0` and `v1.3.0`. I believe that it's much simplified compared to previous iterations, even though new features were added.  

Small disclaimer, I've started playing in React in spare time in October 2017, so I'm still quite a rookie :)  

TODO:
- ~~Generic version of estimator as well (w/o being tied to flats).~~ Semi-finished, there's still copywriting references all over the place.
- Multilingual application.
    - ~~Simple translation with predefined strings.~~
    - ~~Based on language browser settings.~~
    - ~~Easily overridable.~~
- Generate variations from base calculation.
- ~~Save generated entries in local storage so you can reach all of them later on (currently only saving last entries).~~
